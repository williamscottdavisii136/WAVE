# Phase 2B Three USB to USB-C Direct Mac Phone Cable Addendum 2026-07-30

## Purpose

This append-only addendum records three owner-provided direct physical cable routes between the Macintosh environment and the Samsung smartphone environment for the Phase 2B three-layer communication, billing, handshake, certificate/trust, request, and reply taxonomy.

This is a public-safe record. It does not publish serial numbers, phone numbers, IMEI values, MAC addresses, IP addresses, private account details, private credential values, token values, certificate values, cookies, session material, recovery codes, MFA codes, private network names, private legal materials, or operational secrets.

## Owner-provided physical link profile

```text
CABLE GROUP: three direct Mac-to-phone cables
CABLE TYPE: USB connector on Mac side and USB-C connector on Samsung phone side, owner-stated
COUNT: 3 cables
ASSIGNMENT: one cable for each Mac profile
FUNCTION: direct physical Mac-to-Samsung-phone connection
```

## Public-safe host mapping

```text
MAC CABLE ROUTE 1: MacBook Air 2015 Monterey profile to Samsung phone profile through direct USB/USB-C cable
MAC CABLE ROUTE 2: MacBook Air 2015 secondary profile to Samsung phone profile through direct USB/USB-C cable
MAC CABLE ROUTE 3: MacBook Pro 2012 Yosemite profile to Samsung phone profile through direct USB/USB-C cable
```

## Phase 2B handshake significance

A direct cable does not have one fixed meaning. Each candidate must classify the actual mode negotiated by the Mac and phone.

```text
POSSIBLE USB MODE CLASSES:
charging-only;
file transfer / MTP;
photo transfer / PTP;
USB tethering;
ADB / debugging, only if owner-authorized and enabled;
USB accessory mode;
local backup / restore;
local media import;
local device trust prompt;
unknown.
```

## Required request / reply classification

For each AI-agent, AI-chatbot, local runtime, IDE extension, terminal runner, or file-processing workflow using a direct Mac-to-phone cable, Phase 2B must classify:

```text
origin Mac profile;
destination phone profile;
cable identifier class;
physical transport class;
USB negotiated mode;
phone unlock requirement;
phone trust prompt requirement;
Mac-side driver/app requirement;
Android-side permission requirement;
credential store touched yes/no/unknown;
file system exposed yes/no/partial/unknown;
media store exposed yes/no/unknown;
USB tethering active yes/no/unknown;
ADB/debugging active yes/no/unknown;
local-only transfer yes/no/unknown;
cloud/provider contact yes/no/unknown;
AI-provider billing involved yes/no/unknown;
subscription entitlement checked yes/no/unknown;
token/quota meter touched yes/no/unknown;
code execution local/remote/none/unknown;
MCP/BYOK/Gatekeeper-Vault route involved yes/no/unknown;
private value published no.
```

## Billing and authorization consequence

```text
A physical cable connection is not cloud billing by itself.
A physical cable connection is not AI-provider billing authorization.
A physical cable connection is not subscription authorization.
A physical cable connection is not token/quota authorization.
A physical cable connection is not credential-transfer authorization by itself.
A physical cable connection is not certificate-transfer authorization by itself.
```

Cloud/provider billing may become involved only if an app, agent, chatbot, IDE, terminal runner, backup service, sync service, indexing service, model endpoint, embedding service, OCR/transcription service, code-execution service, or other provider-controlled service receives, processes, uploads, indexes, embeds, stores, or analyzes data from the connected phone or Mac.

## Negative boundary

Unknown cable mode is not approval.
Unknown USB negotiation is not approval.
Unknown trust prompt status is not approval.
Unknown phone permission status is not approval.
Unknown credential-store access is not approval.
Unknown provider route is not approval.
Unknown billing route is not zero cost.
