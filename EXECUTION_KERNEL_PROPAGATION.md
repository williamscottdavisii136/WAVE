- This is not a lost-project recovery framework.
- Do not import foreign project structures.
- Do not commit secrets.
- Do not deploy publicly unless expressly authorized.
- Do not create Cloudflare deployment unless expressly authorized.
- Use repository-local scope only.
- Collect evidence before marking work complete.
- User retains final authority over AI actions.
