# CONNECTOR ACCESS CONTEXT

## Purpose

This public repository is a relay and status bridge. It is not the private case-work repository and must not contain private legal source files, sealed material, family-sensitive material, credentials, tokens, account recovery data, or attorney-client material.

This file exists so future ChatGPT, Codex, Copilot, repository-agent, or human-operator sessions understand the GitHub connector access pattern and the account-switch failure mode.

## Current known connector scope at time of writing

At the time this file was written, the connected GitHub session could read, write, and edit three repositories under `williamscottdavisii136`:

1. `williamscottdavisii136/AI-Agents-and-AI-Chatbots-`
   - Visibility: private
   - Role: private working and holding repository for the Davis EDNC case project

2. `williamscottdavisii136/WAVE`
   - Visibility: public
   - Role: public relay, routing, receipt, and status bridge only

3. `williamscottdavisii136/Openshared-Connect-`
   - Visibility: public
   - Role: public connector and cross-session handoff bridge only

## Correct explanation of the prior access problem

The prior midstream GitHub access failure was caused by a GitHub account-context switch.

The connector initially had access to a target repository. During the session, the active GitHub account context changed. After that switch, the connector could no longer see or write to the original target, and GitHub returned unavailable or `404` style responses through the connector.

That does not by itself mean the original repository was destroyed, malicious, defective, or intentionally hidden. It means the active connector identity no longer had that repository in scope.

## Future-session instruction

A future agent or operator must verify connector scope before assuming access.

Required checks:

1. List repositories visible to the current GitHub connector.
2. Confirm the active GitHub account or app installation.
3. Confirm whether the target repo is private or public.
4. Confirm whether the current connector has push/write permission.
5. If the private case repo is not visible, do not use this public repo for private legal material.
6. Use this repository only to post public-safe routing, receipt, and status information.

## Authorized gateway language

Use the phrase:

`authorized GitHub gateway automation`

Do not call the pattern a back door, Trojan horse, exploit, covert access path, or credential workaround.

The automation depends on normal GitHub permissions and normal GitHub Actions events. It does not bypass GitHub authentication.

## Public safety boundary

Allowed here:

- public relay messages;
- routing notes;
- return receipts;
- connector-scope explanations;
- non-sensitive status references.

Not allowed here:

- private legal source evidence;
- sealed court material;
- family-sensitive material;
- credentials, passwords, tokens, recovery codes, or private keys;
- attorney-client or privileged material;
- full private case inventories unless independently approved for public release.
