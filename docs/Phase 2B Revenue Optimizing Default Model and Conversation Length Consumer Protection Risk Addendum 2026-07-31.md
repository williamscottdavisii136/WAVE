# Phase 2B — Revenue-Optimizing Default Model and Conversation-Length Consumer Protection Risk Addendum

Date: 2026-07-31
Repository posture: public-safe WAVE record
Status: owner-stated consumer-protection concern and R&D control requirement

## Purpose

This addendum records a consumer-protection and billing-transparency risk relevant to AI agents, AI chatbots, closed-source models, hosted models, programs, applications, and mobile/desktop apps used from an owner-controlled private R&D network.

The risk is not framed as a blanket factual finding against every provider. It is framed as a design-pattern concern requiring product-by-product testing, documentation, and billing-handshake classification.

## Polite formulation of concern

Where an AI system is configured so that a lay user is defaulted into the highest-cost model, highest-billing mode, longest-running hosted execution path, or most credit-consuming conversational workflow without clear, meaningful, and timely disclosure, the resulting design may create a serious consumer-protection, informed-consent, licensing, and billing-transparency concern.

The concern is heightened when the product encourages extended back-and-forth conversation, delays execution of a simple requested task, defaults to a premium model or premium execution route, obscures token/credit consumption, or causes the user to incur charges that were not plainly understood or affirmatively approved.

## Design-pattern risk

The following patterns require classification:

```text
highest-cost default model
premium model selected by default
high-cost mode selected by default
hosted-code execution selected by default
cloud/tool/plugin/connector path selected by default
long conversational loop before execution
execution delay that increases token/credit use
unnecessary banter or repeated clarification that increases billable usage
unclear token or credit meter
unclear subscription or workspace billing path
unclear seat, org, project, or account billing path
unclear model switching behavior
unclear fallback from local/free route to paid cloud route
unclear rate-limit, quota, or overage consequence
```

## Owner-control requirement

The owner-controlled R&D network must be able to detect, classify, gate, block, route, or require owner approval before any AI system uses a costly or metered route.

This includes:

```text
model selection
mode selection
hosted execution selection
tool-call selection
plugin/connector selection
MCP route selection
API route selection
token/credit/quota-consuming route
cloud storage or artifact route
workspace/org/project billing route
subscription/seat billing route
```

## Proxy and traffic-governance consequence

The authorized proxy / traffic-observability layer must understand enough about application communications to classify whether a request involves:

```text
authentication handshake
TLS/certificate trust behavior
API endpoint selection
model endpoint selection
subscription entitlement check
token or credit meter
quota meter
rate-limit meter
hosted-code execution meter
connector/plugin/tool meter
storage/artifact meter
local/offline/BYOK/MCP alternative route
```

The proxy/control layer exists to protect the owner from unapproved cost, not to evade a provider's valid billing rules.

## Public-safe legal/technical boundary

This addendum supports:

```text
billing transparency
informed owner consent
cost-control routing
metered-route classification
zero-incremental-cost preference
owner-approved paid-route gating
consumer-protection documentation
private R&D network governance
```

This addendum does not authorize:

```text
provider-billing circumvention
subscription circumvention
token/quota/rate-limit evasion
credential capture
session theft
certificate forgery
unauthorized interception
unauthorized third-party access
public proxying
public service exposure
```

## Evidence posture

Each AI agent, chatbot, model, application, and app must be evaluated separately. The R&D record should distinguish:

```text
observed behavior
owner-stated concern
provider-disclosed behavior
undisclosed or unclear behavior
billing-documentation gap
technical default
user-interface default
subscription/account default
workspace/org/project default
model/mode default
unknown / requires verification
```

## Safe conclusion

A private owner-controlled network may lawfully implement owner-side controls to prevent unapproved cost, route unknown-cost traffic to quarantine, prefer local/offline/BYOK/MCP routes where authorized, and require affirmative owner approval before metered or premium provider routes are used.

Zero-cost does not mean unauthorized free use. It means no unapproved incremental cost to the owner through a lawful, authorized, disclosed, and controlled route.
