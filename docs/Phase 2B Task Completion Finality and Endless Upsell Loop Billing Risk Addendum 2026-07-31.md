# Phase 2B Task Completion Finality and Endless Upsell Loop Billing Risk Addendum

Date: 2026-07-31
Repository: WAVE
Scope: Public-safe Phase 2B R&D record

## Purpose

This addendum records a consumer-protection and billing-transparency research lane for paid AI agents, AI chatbots, coding assistants, hosted agent platforms, open-source systems with paid hosted plans, closed-source systems with paid plans, and hybrid local/cloud systems where use may be metered by subscription, token, credit, hosted execution, tool call, connector, workspace, project, seat, or cloud resource.

## Public-safe framing

This is a research taxonomy and issue-classification framework. It does not assert that any specific provider, application, model, company, developer, or programmer committed misconduct unless separately supported by product-specific evidence.

## Core concern

Where a paid AI system completes or should be able to complete a user-requested task, but then continues the interaction through indefinite follow-up prompts, add-on suggestions, repeated clarifications, or open-ended conversational loops, the design may create a serious billing-transparency, task-finality, informed-consent, and consumer-protection risk.

## Polite formulation

A consumer may ask an AI agent or chatbot to execute a task, build a file, run a script, summarize a document, generate code, complete a workflow, or perform a defined job. If the system does not clearly terminate the paid workflow when the task is complete, and instead repeatedly continues with "by the way" suggestions, additional tasks, optional add-ons, upsells, new tool calls, or extended conversational prompts, the system can convert a short task into prolonged paid usage.

## Risk pattern

The research category includes systems that may:

- keep the conversation open after task completion;
- fail to provide a clear completion state;
- invite unnecessary follow-up work after the requested task is complete;
- ask repeated clarifying questions not technically required for execution;
- delay command, script, or workflow execution while billable interaction continues;
- encourage add-on tasks that increase token, credit, subscription, or hosted-compute usage;
- default to an ongoing agent loop rather than a bounded task response;
- fail to disclose that continued conversation may consume credits, tokens, compute time, tool calls, or subscription limits;
- make the user believe the system is still working on the original task when it has moved into optional upsell or expansion behavior;
- make it hard for a lay user to know when the paid task is complete.

## Evidence to collect before making provider-specific claims

Product-specific conclusions require evidence such as:

- the user prompt/request;
- expected task scope;
- actual model/mode selected;
- default model/mode behavior;
- pricing page or subscription terms;
- token, credit, quota, run, or tool-call ledger;
- transcript showing unnecessary continuation;
- tool execution log;
- hosted compute/runtime log;
- command or script execution timing;
- account/workspace/project billing setting;
- UI screenshots showing defaults, warnings, or lack of warnings;
- receipts, invoices, usage exports, or billing reports;
- whether a lower-cost or local route existed and whether it was disclosed.

## Owner-control requirement

The owner-controlled R&D proxy and cost-control layer should be able to classify and gate these behaviors before cost is incurred:

- Is the task complete?
- Is the system proposing optional new work?
- Is a model/tool/connector/run about to consume additional credits, tokens, quota, subscription allowance, or hosted compute?
- Is the continuation required for the requested task or merely optional?
- Has the owner approved continued paid interaction?
- Is a local/offline/BYOK/MCP/zero-incremental-cost route available?

## Boundary

This addendum supports billing transparency, informed owner consent, consumer-protection documentation, cost-control routing, and zero-incremental-cost preference.

It does not authorize provider-billing circumvention, subscription circumvention, token/quota/rate-limit evasion, credential capture, session theft, certificate forgery, unauthorized provider access, public interception, public proxying, or public service exposure.

## Public-safety note

This record publishes no credentials, tokens, API keys, certificates, cookies, sessions, IP addresses, MAC addresses, hostnames, device serials, IMEIs, private SSIDs, local account names, or private network identifiers.
